# Trailhead Tasks

I've been going through some of the Trailhead tasks to refresh my memory. I've been uploading a folder for all fo the code written and some screenshots to show the results.

## [Transform SQL Queries to SOQL Queries in a Lightning App](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/projects/transform-sql-queries-to-soql-queries-in-a-lightning-app)

An intermediate level task that gives you some practice with:
  * installing a package
  * configuring page layouts
  * writing SOQL
  * creating Apex classes
